            <p>If you choose to subscribe to any of our premium Services, these are the payment and billing terms that
                apply. Paid services and billing will auto-renew unless you cancel. You may cancel at any time.
            </p>

                    <p> Payment Terms</p>
                </li>

                <p>
                    We offer certain premium versions of the Services (e.g. Gold Edition and Professional Edition) (the
                    “Premium Services”) for a fee. By subscribing for any of the Premium Services, you agree to our
                    Terms, and any additional terms and conditions that are provided here.

                    The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced services, features and functionality
                    (including, for example, a free mobile app, enhanced trends and analysis, an ad-free browsing
                    experience, the ability to link accounts with friends, our "Ask the Oracle" which recommends best
                    food for nutrients and priority support). By subscribing for and using the Premium Services, you
                    agree to pay any fees or other incurred charges that apply to the Premium Services (such as
                    subscription fees). When you subscribe for the Premium Services, you must designate and provide
                    information about your preferred payment method (“Payment Method”). This information must be
                    complete and accurate, and you are responsible for keeping it up to date. You hereby expressly
                    authorize us to collect from your Payment Method the appropriate fees charged for the Premium
                    Services and for any other purchases you elect to make via the Premium Services. You can choose to
                    pay for the Premium Services on a monthly, biannual or annual basis. All fees due for the Premium
                    Services are payable in advance, and will be billed automatically to the Payment Method at the start
                    of the monthly, biannual or annual Premium Service period, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated,
                    Premium Services will auto-renew until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services.

                    When you provide any payment account information to Cronometer, you represent to Cronometer that you
                    are the authorized user of that payment account.

                    <p>Termination and Cancellation of Premium Services</p>
                </li>

                <p>If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium Services, we may make
                    reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or
                    terminate your access to the Premium Services with or without notice to you.

                    You may cancel your subscription to the Premium Services at any time through your Account settings
                    or by submitting a cancellation request to us via email at: support@cronometer.com. The cancellation
                    of a Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have
                    the same level of access to the Premium Service through the remainder of such billing cycle. For
                    example, if you are billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be charged
                    for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the Premium Service through the end of that
                    month.

                    There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium Service. Cronometer reserves
                    the right, but without any obligation, to review its no refund policy upon request and on a case by
                    case basis.</p>

                <p>
                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change the fee we charge for Premium
                    Services at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the
                    new prices on or through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email notification.
                    If you do not wish to pay the new fee, you can cancel the applicable Premium Service prior to the
                    change going into effect.

                    <p>Refunds, Renewal and Cancellation</p>
                </li>

                <p>
                    When you sign up for a recurring subscription, membership or other ongoing Services, you have the
                    right to cancel the recurring arrangement in writing within seven (7) calendar days after you first
                    entered into the recurring arrangement and you will receive a full refund of any fees paid within
                    thirty (30) days. If however, you access, download, install or use the Services related to the
                    recurring arrangement, you lose your right to withdraw from or cancel the recurring arrangement and
                    your fees are non-refundable. The period for any auto-renewal or recurring arrangement will be the
                    same as the period you originally ordered unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of purchase.
                    The charges made in connection with any auto-renewal or recurring arrangements will also be at the
                    same rates as were in effect at the time of your original order unless we give you prior notice of
                    any change to such charges before such charges are made for any subsequent renewal period. If you
                    cancel an auto-renewal or recurring arrangement after the seven (7) day cancellation period or after
                    you have accessed, downloaded, installed or used the Services you ordered, you will not be entitled
                    to a refund and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then current recurring period
                    unless you request an earlier termination date in writing. Cancellation requests must be submitted
                    by email to Cronometer at: support@cronometer.com
                </p>

                    <p>Gift, Discount or Coupon Codes</p>
                </li>

                <p>
                    If you have received a gift, discount or coupon code (a "Code") to a Premium Service, the following
                    terms and conditions apply in addition to the terms and conditions of the specific Code. To redeem a
                    Code, log in to the applicable edition and enter the applicable Code in the subscription process.
                    All Codes can only be applied to Accounts that are not already subscribing to Premium Services.
                    Codes cannot be exchanged, refunded or redeemed for cash or payment of Accounts. You are responsible
                    to use a Code before it expires and expired Codes cannot be refunded or extended. You are also
                    responsible for cancelling or terminating the Premium Service before the end of the free or a
                    discounted period if you do not want to continue with the Premium Service at the regular price.
                    Cronometer may cancel Codes at any time without any liability or responsibility to compensate the
                    Code holder whatsoever.

                <p>
                    It is Cronometer’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that are made in
                    compliance with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”). If you wish
                    to provide notice of alleged copyright infringement, you must provide the necessary information in
                    the form required by 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (c) and in accordance with the provisions set out below.
                    Cronometer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate or suspend access to the Site, and/or
                    Services or any portion thereof, and/or cancel the Account of any user who repeatedly infringes or
                    who is repeatedly alleged to have infringed the copyright or other intellectual property rights of
                    third parties. Cronometer accommodates and does not interfere with standard digital rights
                    management and other technical measures employed by copyright owners to protect their proprietary
                    materials.

                    Cronometer requires all notices of alleged copyright infringement (a “Copyright Notice”) to be in
                    writing and delivered via regular mail, e-mail or fax to Cronometer or its agent in order to enable
                    us to review and respond to your complaint as efficiently as possible while maintaining compliance
                    with applicable laws. If you are providing a Copyright Notice under the DMCA, you must provide the
                    detailed information outlined below. You should also be aware that, under the DMCA, you could be
                    held liable for damages (including any costs and attorney’s fees) if you materially misrepresent
                    that material or activity is infringing your copyright. If you are not certain whether the material
                    or activity about which you are complaining infringes your copyright, you should obtain competent
                    legal advice. If you are not subject to the laws of the United States or the infringing content is
                    not hosted in the United States, the DMCA may not apply. If you are not certain whether the DMCA
                    applies, you should obtain competent legal advice. The full text of the DMCA is available from the
                    United States Copyright Office website at: http://www.copyright.gov/

                        We assume no responsibility for loss or damage as a result of interaction with other community

                        confidentiality rights;(vii) message or materials which are antisocial, disruptive or

            </li>

            <p>
                You and Cronometer agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
                Terms, any policy referred to herein, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or the
                validity thereof, or the use of the Site, Services or Content (collectively, the “Disputes”) will be
                settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to (a) bring an individual
                action in the British Columbia Provincial Court (Small Claims Division) or British Columbia Civil
                Resolution Tribunal (Small Claims Division) subject to the applicable jurisdictional limits of those
                bodies, and (b) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
                prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights,
                trademarks, trade secrets, patents, confidential information or other intellectual property or
                proprietary rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Cronometer are each irrevocably waiving the
                right to a trial by jury and the right to participate as a plaintiff or a class member in any purported
                class action or similar representative proceeding. Further, unless you and Cronometer expressly agree in
                writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside
                over any form of class or representative proceeding. This “Dispute Resolution” section shall survive any
                termination of these Terms.

                Any arbitration to be conducted pursuant to this “Dispute Resolution” section shall be conducted before
                a single arbitrator in accordance with the procedural rules of the British Columbia International
                Commercial Arbitration Centre. The venue of the arbitration shall be Kelowna, British Columbia Canada.
